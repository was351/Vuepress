An engineering notebook is arguably the most important tool you can have in your possession. When used correctly, it contains a wealth of knowledge and is an excellent way to display progress.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/book.550413b6.png" alt="An Image"></p> <p>An engineering notebook can contain sketches, logs, ideas, timelines, reflections, team information, and loads of other stuff. Judging is a big part of VEX Robotics competitions, and in order to have your robot judged, you must have an engineering notebook. A well made and upkept engineering notebook that outshines the competition can even help you win an award.</p> <h2 id="contents"><a href="#contents" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contents</h2> <p>A typical engineering notebook has some important items that all teams should implement.</p> <p>The first of these, is a table of contents on the very first page. This will help both your team in keeping track of what the notebook contains, but will also help anyone else viewing the notebook. In order to have an effect table of contents, each page you use will have to be numbered (typically on the bottom right of the page). You can update/expand the table of contents as you use more pages.</p> <p>The second item that should be in your engineering notebook is a team bio. This will help you appear more professional, and having defined roles for each team member written down will ensure that everyone knows what they are responsible for.</p> <p>The third item that you should have is drawings and sketches. Make sure to title each page with the date and what the drawing(s) are supposed to be. Do not worry about making very neat/visually appealing drawings, but instead focus on getting all your visualizations on paper, to show your design process. Later, we will go over how to draw effectively.</p> <p>The fourth item that should be in an engineering notebook is some form of daily log/journal entries. This step is extremely important to show that your team has been working hard and has made genuine progress. Judges want to see that your ideas and robot have genuinely evolved over time, and that your team can talk about what challenges or successes you have had. A daily log can simply state what was accomplished each day, and journal entries can go into lengthy detail about important milestones.</p> <p>The fifth item to be included is a project management timeline. In order to show that your team is well organized, you must have a timeline that states when tasks will be accomplished. This does not only make your team look organized however, it will also genuinely help keep your team on track. It is easy to fall behind if a proper schedule is not followed.</p> <p>The last item to touch upon is add-ins. If there is ever any material produced outside of your notebook, it is acceptable to paste it into the notebook, with the proper dates and notations.</p> <p><strong>Notebook Etiquette</strong></p> <p>Above, we covered the absolutely necessary contents of an engineering notebook, but there are a few rules that must be followed to keep a notebook in good condition.</p> <p>Firstly, what type of notebook you choose matters. Your notebook must not consist of loose paper. You have to use a proper bound notebook, such as the ones linked below:</p> <p>https://www.vexrobotics.com/276-3023.html</p> <p>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZP2XPH/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1</p> <p>https://www.amazon.com/Mead-Composition-Notebooks-Sheets-38301/dp/B071NRXVBP/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=composition+notebook&amp;qid=1596915144&amp;sr=8-3</p> <p>The notebook you choose can be any colour (although black looks the most professional), but it has to be solid colours, not fancy/unprofessional notebooks that look like this:</p> <p>https://www.amazon.com/Composition-Notebook-Workbook-Students-Turquoise/dp/1099104475/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&amp;keywords=compostion+notebook&amp;qid=1596915377&amp;sr=8-13</p> <p>The second rule is about penmanship. You must always write in pen, using your best possible penmanship. Pencil is not appropriate because it can easily be erased/altered. Neat handwriting ensures your writing is easily read by anyone. You must also always use correct punctuation/spelling.</p> <p>The third rule is about your drawings. Always use a ruler or straight edge when formatting/drawing you designs, and never edit previous drawings to display progress. Instead, make a new drawing and write a note explaining the changes. This way, the two drawings can be compared.</p> <p>Lastly, NEVER remove pages from the engineering notebook. If you make a small mistake, cross it out and continue working. For large mistakes, cross out the page and try again on another page. A strategy to prevent such miss happenings is to first draw in pencil, and then go over it in pen.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <p>Here are a few links for more sources of information on engineering notebooks, as there is still much more to cover for more advanced notebooks.</p> <p>A helpful YouTube video – https://youtu.be/AmSqKU0_Zk0</p> <p>The rubrics used by judges to assess your team interview and notebook – https://www.roboticseducation.org/resources_library/judge-guide/</p> <p>The vex wiki page on engineering notebooks –https://vexwiki.org/robotics_competitions/vex_robotics_competition/engineering_notebook</p> <h2 id="judging-presentations"><a href="#judging-presentations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Judging Presentations</h2> <p>When you attend a VEX Robotics competition, a big part of the competition is judging. Judging presentations are not only required for your team to win awards, they are also an important way of receiving feedback on your robot and engineering notebook. The judges at competitions are competent, knowledgeable individuals that can help you improve. Judging presentations are NOT just about impressing the judges.</p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p> <p>The first thing to note about judging presentations is that it up to YOU to find time to go to the judges. You will have to find enough time in between your matches to go and do your judging presentation. If there is a long lineup for judging, it may be a good idea to have one team member get in line to hold a spot for your team. Doing judging early on before any matches start might be a good time, because other teams are often making last minute adjustments or practicing during that time.</p> <p>When you lineup for judging, your team needs to have the robot and the engineering notebook with them. If you wish to show your robot in action, make sure to bring your controller and ensure that both the robot and the controller are charged.</p> <p>The format/flow of the judging presentation is not always the same. Sometimes judges simply let you present you robot and notebook in any way you wish, and ask questions in between or after. Sometimes the judges will lead the discussion, and you may be bombarded with questions. Regardless, it is a good idea to have planned and rehearsed some sort of presentation before hand. You must make sure that every team member is able to answer questions, and that every team member contributes during the presentation. Do NOT have a single person do all of the talking. If you wish, you can have a PowerPoint prepared on a laptop/tablet and bring that with you, but judges will be more interested in what you have to say and your physical notebook, then what the PowerPoint says.</p> <p>Judging may seem like a daunting task, but if you do go and present, you will find that it is not as daunting as it seems. Good luck, and make sure you have fun!</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
